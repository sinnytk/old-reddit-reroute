# Browser addon to redirect to old Reddit
## For people who share the my love for old.reddit.com

### How to install?
- Clone the repository or manually download it
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Enable "developer mode" on top right
- Click "Load unpacked" on top left and browse the cloned/downloaded directory
- Voila!, browse to www.reddit.com and you shall be redirected to old.reddit.com

### Why not just upload on Chrome Web Store?
They ask for $5 developer account fees, don't have any payment options right now.
